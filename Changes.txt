2011-09-20, S3QL 1.1.4

  * Fixed a typo that caused errors when trying to remove any blocks
    that have been committed to the backend.

  * Improved accuracy of s3qlstat during active file transfers
    (but still not 100% accurate).

  * Fixed some theoretical deadlocks.
  
  * contrib/benchmark.py is now working again and also takes into
    account the throughput from userspace to S3QL.
  
2011-09-18, S3QL 1.1.3

  * Fixed a race condition in the local backend that resulted in
    errors of the form "[Errno 17] File exists: [bucket path]".
    
  * Added Google Storage backend.
  
  * Added backend for general, S3 compatible storage services.

  * Fixed a bug that caused S3QL to complain about the backend having
    lost objects when trying to download an object before its upload
    was completed. This could happen because locking was done based on
    inode and block number rather than object id, and the
    de-duplication feature can reuse an object for another inode
    before the upload is completed.

  * Fixed a data corruption bug. If a data block was changed while
    being uploaded to the backend, and a second, identical data block
    was flushed while the upload was in progress, but before the first
    block was changed, the second data block was linked to the
    *modified* data. This happened because changes to an object in
    transit were only checked for after the upload completed, leaving
    a window in which the contents of the upload object did not agree
    with its stored hash.

    This problem can be detected by verifying the hash values of all
    stored data blocks. This procedure will automatically be done when
    the file system is updated to the newest revision, but may take a
    longer time since every object needs to be downloaded and checked.

2011-09-08, S3QL 1.1.2

  * The modules for communicating with the different storage providers
    have been completely rewritten, resulting in improved performance,
    more features and better maintainability.

  * S3 buckets can now be used with arbitrary prefixes, allowing to
    store more than one S3QL file system in a bucket.

  * The format of the --authinfo file has changed. See the
    documentation for details of the new format. To avoid breaking
    backwards compatibility, the default file is now called authinfo2.

  * Network errors are now handled much more consistently.
  
  * There is a new --nfs option for mount.s3ql that needs to be used
    when the S3QL file system will be exported over NFS.

  * The local backend now stores data and metadata in the same file,
    so it needs only half as many files as before.

  * The --homedir option has been replaced by the more finely grained
    --authfile, --cachedir and --log options.

  * S3QL can now log directly to syslog.

  * The sftp storage backend has been dropped. The recommended way to
    use S3QL over ssh is to use sshfs
    (http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html) with S3QL's local
    backend.

  * fsck now checks if all indices have been created. This avoids
    a huge performance problem when mount.s3ql was interrupted
    after downloading metadata, but before creating the indices.
  
2011-07-23, S3QL 1.1 (development version)

  * Restructured metadata. This should also significantly reduce the
    size of the SQLite database file.

  * Fixed license typo in file header comments, license
    is GNU GPL Version 3, not LGPL.
  
  * Fixed problem with fsck.s3ql generating extraordinary long
    filenames in /lost+found and then crashing. 

  * When called as root, use umount rather than fusermount for
    compatibility with FUSE4BSD.

2011-05-20, S3QL 1.0.1

  * Disabled WAL mode again for now because of unexpected problems
    with s3qlcp, s3qllock and s3qlrm (performance going down orders
    of magnitude, and *very* large *.db-wal file in ~/.s3ql).

2011-05-13, S3QL 1.0

  * S3QL has been declared stable after 2 years of beta-testing did
    not reveal any data-critical bugs.

  * Fixed occasional assertion error when calling s3qlctrl flushcache
    or unmounting the file system.

  * Fixed a race condition when a block is expired while it is in
    transit but has already been modified again.

  * expire_backups.py no longer has an --init option, the state file
    is created automatically if this operation is safe. Instead, there
    is a --reconstruct-state option that can be used to try to
    reconstruct a lost state file.

  * The size of symbolic links is now reported as the length of
    the target instead of zero. This used to confuse revision
    control systems like git and hg.

  * Added man pages for all S3QL commands.

2011-02-04, S3QL 0.30

  * S3QL now defaults to use unencrypted HTTP connections, which
    significantly improves performance when using the S3 backend. For
    an encrypted file system, all data is already encrypted anyway,
    and authentication data is never transmitted in plain text even
    for unencrypted file systems. Therefore, the use of SSL brings
    little gain for most users. To force SSL usage, the new --ssl
    option can be used.

  * mkfs.s3ql now has a --force option to overwrite an existing file
    system.
    
2010-12-30, S3QL 0.29

  * The FUSE interface has been rewritten using Cython and factored
    out into a separate package, http://code.google.com/p/python-llfuse/.
    
    This should result in easier installation, better performance and
    better maintainability.


2010-12-19, S3QL 0.28

  * "s3qlctrl upload-meta" now works even if the file system has been
    mounted with --metadata-upload-interval=0.
    
  * File system metadata is now permanently cached locally. This
    significantly reduces the time required to mount the file system.
    
  * The documentation is now also included in PDF format.

2010-12-11, S3QL 0.27

  * The authinfo file now supports passwords that include white space.
  
  * The s3qladm command can now be used to download metadata backups.
  
  * The --strip-meta option for mount.s3ql has been removed, redundant
    data is now always stripped before upload.

  * mount.s3ql now has a --upstart option so that it can easily run as
    an upstart job. An example job definition is included in
    contrib/s3ql.conf.
    
  * s3qlctrl now has an 'upload-meta' command to trigger a metadata
    upload while the file system is mounted.

  * Fixed a bug that preserved old data when truncating a file to
    zero. If you ever had fsck errors of the form

    Size of inode [ddd] ([filename]) does not agree with number of
    blocks

    then the affected files may contain additional, old data at the
    end that is not supposed to be there.
    
  
2010-10-30, S3QL 0.26

  * Fixed a problem with the sftp backend failing because it tries to
    access a file locally.

  * Various minor bugfixes

2010-09-28, S3QL 0.25

  * A critical bug that could cause backups to be deleted too early
    and potentially break the whole backup strategy has been fixed in
    contrib/expire_backups.py.
    
    The new version has changed semantics that and also copes
    significantly better when backups are made in irregular time
    intervals.

  * S3QL should now respond with more consistent performance when
    accessing the file system while s3qlcp, s3qllock or s3qlrm is
    running at the same time.
    
  * When enabling debug output for the `UploadManager` module, S3QL
    now logs detailed messages about de-duplication, upload and
    compression performance.

2010-09-18, S3QL 0.24

  * Fixed a deadlock that could cause the mount.s3ql process to hang
    around after umount.
    
  * Fixed a bug that caused S3QL to consider all downloaded blocks as
    dirty and resulted in unneccessary checksum calculations on
    expiration.

  * s3qlctrl can now change the log level at runtime.
  
  * s3qladm delete now also deletes any local stale cache files.
    
  * Periodic metadata upload can now be disabled completely by
    specifying an interval of zero.
    
  
2010-09-03, S3QL 0.23

  * Fixed problem with global_lock.py not being installed by setup.py

2010-08-31, S3QL 0.22

  * Fixed a bug that could cause file system errors when calling
    s3qlrm on a lot of really large files.

  * The sftp backend is now significantly faster, thanks to skyang2009
    for the patch.

  * s3qlctrl can now change the cache size of a mounted file system.

2010-08-09, S3QL 0.21

  * The metadata is now only uploaded if there have been any changes.

  * mount.s3ql now supports several parallel compression and
    encryption threads with the --compression-threads option.

  * S3QL now supports "immutable directories". This important new
    feature can be used to protect backups from modification after
    they have completed. See the User's Guide for details.

  * Using S3 RRS is now deprecated, see User's Guide for details.

  * fsck.s3ql now moves damaged files due to data lost by a backend
    into /lost+found/

  * expire_backups is no longer installed automatically and can now be
    found in the contrib/ directory.

  * S3QL now comes with sample backup script in contrib/s3_backup.sh
  
  * Added contrib/pcp.py, an rsync wrapper to recursively copy
    directory trees with several parallel rsync processes.
  
2010-08-01, S3QL 0.20.1

  * Hotfix for s3qladm upgrade.

2010-08-01, S3QL 0.20

  * Added contrib/make_dummy.py. This script creates a dummy copy of a
    bucket that contains only the file system metadata. The resulting
    dummy can be used for debugging.

  * Mounting with the local and sftp backends is now significantly
    faster, because the object tree is no longer traversed completely.

  * Fixed a race condition that occasionally produced errors when
    deleting large files (spanning multiple blocks).

  * The file system now stays responsive to other requests while
    compressing blocks.

  * s3qlstat is now much faster since the size after de-duplication
    does not need to be queried from the backend anymore but is stored
    in the metadata.


2010-07-25, S3QL 0.19

  * Fixed various smaller bugs, see Mercurial changelog for details.

2010-07-11, S3QL 0.18

  * Added --strip-meta option to mount.s3ql

  * Added --metadata-upload-interval option to mount.s3ql. This allows
    to periodically upload updated metadata even while the file system
    is mounted.

  * stat.s3ql, tune.s3ql and cp.s3ql have been renamed to s3qlstat,
    s3qladm and s3qlcp respectively.

  * sftp backend is working again

  * Added the s3qlctrl command.

2010-06-29, S3QL 0.17

  * The local and sftp backends now spread their files into different
    sub-directories.
     
  * Amazon S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) is now supported. To
    use it, use a storage url of the form s3rr://<bucket> instead of
    s3://<bucket>.

2010-06-15, S3QL 0.16

  * Fixed problem with readdir() returning entries twice or skipping
    them if files are added or removed while readdir() is in progress.

  * Fixed build problem on Gentoo.

  * fsck.s3ql now does a rudimentary check if the file system is still
    mounted to prevent checking a mounted file system.


2010-05-28, S3QL 0.15

  * Fixed test cases to handle systems with low system clock
    resolution.

  * Corrected installation instructions for Debian

  * mount.s3ql: instead of --bzip2, --zlib and --no-compress, there is
    now just one option --compress=<alg>.

  * File system metadata is now uploaded with all indices. This makes
    mounting the file system much faster. Only if LZMA compression has
    been chosen, indices are stripped for storage and regenerated on
    the next mount.

2010-05-14, S3QL 0.14

  * fsck now detects if a cached block is dirty and commits only dirty
    blocks to the backend.

  * Installation in Debian and Ubuntu is now much simpler, it can be
    done completely with aptitude.

2010-05-04, S3QL 0.13

  * S3QL now works with Ubuntu Karmic / 10.04 LTS

  * The test command no longer produces bogus error messages after all
    tests have completed.

  * The umount.s3ql command now properly handles the 'fuser' output
    with Kernel 2.6.32 (before it always refused to unmount, claiming
    that the mount point was busy).

  * The compression can now be specified independently from the
    encryption, so it is possible to have an unencrypted, but
    compressed file system.

  * Apart from zlib, bzip2 and lzma, data can now also be stored
    without any compression.

  * S3QL no longer emulates the . and .. directory entries since this
    is not required by POSIX and makes the code much simpler. This
    also means that the st_nlink value of a directory is not longer 2
    + number of subdirectories.

  * Fixed a bug that caused files to be listed with wrong sizes under
    certain conditions.

  * Added `expire_backups` command and instructions for a simple
    backup solution using S3QL and rsync.

2010-04-27, S3QL 0.12

  * fsck.s3ql now accepts a --batch option to not prompt for any user
    input and requires a --force option to check the file system even
    if it is marked as clean.

  * Fixed a bug in cp.s3ql that caused incorrect st_nlink values in
    the copy.

  * fsck.s3ql has been even more optimized.

  * Fixed a problem with running out of file descriptors when lots of
    objects are deleted.

  * Bucket encryption passwords can now also be stored in the
    ~/.s3ql/authinfo file.

  * mount.s3ql doesn't complain any more if it receives any of the
    standard mount(8) mount options.


2010-04-24, S3QL 0.11

  * S3QL file system can now be mounted from /etc/fstab

  * Metadata now takes significantly less space.

  * Files with extended attributes can now be deleted.

  * Extended attributes can now be listed.

  * It is now possible to choose between zlib, BZip2 and LZMA
    compression every time the file system is mounted.

  * Added contrib/benchmark.py to find out optimal compression method
    for given network bandwidth.

  * fsck.s3ql no longer uses mknod(3) , since that lead to errors on
    e.g. NFS mounted volumes under Fedora.

  * File access, modification and inode change times before 1972 are
    now supported.

  * Fixed a deadlock when removing or overwriting files.

2010-04-21, S3QL 0.10

  * S3QL now depends on FUSE version 2.8

  * Cached blocks are now flushed to the backend as soon as they have
    not been accessed for more than 10 seconds.

  * The setup script now automatically checks and, if necessary,
    installs the Python module dependencies.

  * mkfs.s3ql now creates compressed and encrypted file systems by
    default.

  * Data is now compressed with LZMA instead of Bzip2.

  * Data compression and data upload is now done in parallel, so the
    full network can bandwidth is continuously without breaks for data
    compression.

  * fsck.s3ql is now several orders of magnitude faster. The code has
    been optimized and some special database indices are now
    precalculated.

  * When running cp.s3ql, the attributes of the target directory are
    now immediately refreshed (so that e.g. ls immediately shows the
    correct number of hard links).

  * File removal is now significantly faster, since the network
    transactions are carried out asynchronously as part of the cache
    expiration.

  * mount.s3ql no longer tries to create files with mknod(), since
    that lead to errors on NFS mounted volumes under Fedora.

  * This releases includes a lot of new code, so it may be slightly
    more beta-ish than usual.


2010-04-04, S3QL 0.9

  * The --cachedir, --logfile, --awskey and --credfile options are
    gone and have been replaced by --homedir.

  * ~/.awssecret is no longer read, instead there is a common file
    with authentication data for all backends in ~/.s3ql/authinfo

  * The syntax for mounting S3 buckets is now s3://bucketname instead
    of just the bucket name

  * There is now an SFTP backend. Thanks to Ron Knapp
    <ron.siesta@gmail.com> for most of the code.


2010-03-07, S3QL 0.8

  * S3QL now uses Python's default unittest.py instead of shipping its
    own.

  * Most documentation has been moved from the Wiki into the tarball,
    so that it always corresponds to the correct version.

  * setuptools is now used for installation. This allows .egg
    creation, dependency resolution and generation of the HTML
    documentation.

  * The S3 part of boto has been integrated into S3QL.

2010-02-22, beta7

  * mount.s3ql no longer chdirs into / when daemonizing but into the
    cache directory.

  * Added example backup script in contrib/backup.py

  * tune.s3ql --change-passphrase is working again

  * Added testcase for tune.s3ql --change-passphrase

  * Internal S3 errors are now handled properly by retrying the
    upload.

2010-02-19, beta6

 * tune.s3ql --copy is now *really* working properly (brrr)

2010-02-19, beta5

 * mkfs.s3ql now makes strict checks on the bucket name

 * Removed obsolete mount.s3ql_local from distribution

 * tune.s3ql --copy is now working properly

2010-02-19, beta4

    * tune.s3ql now has a --copy option to copy buckets

    * Storage location for new buckets can be specified in mkfs.s3ql
      and tune.s3ql with --s3-location

    * Fixed a deadlock in mount.s3ql when using local buckets without
      --fg

    * The local: bucket specifier is no longer artificially slow.

    * mount.s3ql: --allow_other is now working

2010-02-04, beta3

    * Fixed a deadlock that caused umount.s3ql to hang indefinitely
      when mount was called without --fg

    * The '.' and '..' directory entries are no longer explicitly
      stored in the database.

    * Rewrote the mechanism to handle delayed updates. Now it no
      longer depends on a small object being propagated relatively
      fast, but is able to handle arbitrary network outages.
