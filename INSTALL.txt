Installation
------------

S3QL depends on several other programs and libraries that have to be installed
first. The best method to satisfy these dependencies depends on your
distribution. In some cases S3QL and all its dependencies can be installed with as
little as three commands, while in other cases more work may be required.

The S3QL Wiki contains installation instructions for quite a few different
Linux distributions:

If your distribution is not included in this list, you can fall back on the
more detailed, but also more complex General Installation Instructions in the
S3QL User's Guide (which is included in the doc/ directory and available
online on http://www.rath.org/s3ql-docs/).
