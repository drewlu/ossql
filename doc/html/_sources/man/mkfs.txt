================================
The :program:`mkfs.s3ql` command
================================

Synopsis
========

::

   mkfs.s3ql [options] <storage url>

Description
===========
  
.. include:: ../include/about.rst

The |command| command creates a new file system in the location
specified by *storage url*. The storage url depends on the backend
that is used. The S3QL User's Guide should be consulted for a
description of the available backends.

Unless you have specified the `--plain` option, `mkfs.s3ql` will ask
you to enter an encryption password. This password will *not* be read
from an authentication file specified with the :cmdopt:`--authfile`
option to prevent accidental creation of an encrypted bucket.


Options
=======

The |command| command accepts the following options.

.. pipeinclude:: ../../bin/mkfs.s3ql --help
   :start-after: show this help message and exit


.. include:: ../include/postman.rst

.. |command| replace:: :command:`mkfs.s3ql`
