.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mount.s3ql [options] <storage url> <mount point>
.ft P
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
S3QL is a file system for online data storage. Before using S3QL, make
sure to consult the full documentation (rather than just the man pages
which only briefly document the available userspace commands).
.sp
The \fBmount.s3ql\fP command mounts the S3QL file system stored in \fIstorage
url\fP in the directory \fImount point\fP. The storage url depends on the
backend that is used. The S3QL User\(aqs Guide should be consulted for a
description of the available backends.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The \fBmount.s3ql\fP command accepts the following options.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-log \ <target>
.
Write logging info into this file. File will be
rotated when it reaches 1 MB, and at most 5 old log
files will be kept. Specify \fBnone\fP to disable
logging. Default: \fB~/.s3ql/mount.log\fP
.TP
.BI \-\-cachedir \ <path>
.
Store cached data in this directory (default:
\fB~/.s3ql)\fP
.TP
.BI \-\-authfile \ <path>
.
Read authentication credentials from this file
(default: \fB~/.s3ql/authinfo2)\fP
.TP
.BI \-\-debug \ <module>
.
activate debugging output from <module>. Use \fBall\fP to
get debug messages from all modules. This option can
be specified multiple times.
.TP
.B \-\-quiet
.
be really quiet
.TP
.B \-\-version
.
just print program version and exit
.TP
.BI \-\-cachesize \ <size>
.
Cache size in kb (default: 102400 (100 MB)). Should be
at least 10 times the blocksize of the filesystem,
otherwise an object may be retrieved and written
several times during a single write() or read()
operation.
.TP
.BI \-\-max\-cache\-entries \ <num>
.
Maximum number of entries in cache (default: 768).
Each cache entry requires one file descriptor, so if
you increase this number you have to make sure that
your process file descriptor limit (as set with
\fBulimit \-n\fP) is high enough (at least the number of
cache entries + 100).
.TP
.B \-\-allow\-other
.
Normally, only the user who called \fBmount.s3ql\fP can
access the mount point. This user then also has full
access to it, independent of individual file
permissions. If the \fB\-\-allow\-other\fP option is
specified, other users can access the mount point as
well and individual file permissions are taken into
account for all users.
.TP
.B \-\-allow\-root
.
Like \fB\-\-allow\-other\fP, but restrict access to the
mounting user and the root user.
.TP
.B \-\-fg
.
Do not daemonize, stay in foreground
.TP
.B \-\-single
.
Run in single threaded mode. If you don\(aqt understand
this, then you don\(aqt need it.
.TP
.B \-\-upstart
.
Stay in foreground and raise SIGSTOP once mountpoint
is up.
.TP
.B \-\-profile
.
Create profiling information. If you don\(aqt understand
this, then you don\(aqt need it.
.TP
.BI \-\-compress \ <name>
.
Compression algorithm to use when storing new data.
Allowed values: \fBlzma\fP, \fBbzip2\fP, \fBzlib\fP, none.
(default: \fBlzma\fP)
.TP
.BI \-\-metadata\-upload\-interval \ <seconds>
.
Interval in seconds between complete metadata uploads.
Set to 0 to disable. Default: 24h.
.TP
.BI \-\-threads \ <no>
.
Number of parallel upload threads to use (default:
auto).
.TP
.B \-\-nfs
.
Support export of S3QL file systems over NFS (default:
False)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH EXIT STATUS

\fBmount.s3ql\fP returns exit code 0 if the operation succeeded and 1 if some
error occured.

.sp
The full S3QL documentation should also be installed somewhere on your
system, conventional locations are \fB/usr/share/doc/s3ql\fP or
\fB/usr/local/doc/s3ql\fP.
