.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft C
s3qlctrl [options] <action> <mountpoint> ...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
where \fBaction\fP may be either of \fBflushcache\fP,
\fBupload\-meta\fP, \fBcachesize\fP or
\fBlog\-metadata\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
S3QL is a file system for online data storage. Before using S3QL, make
sure to consult the full documentation (rather than just the man pages
which only briefly document the available userspace commands).
.sp
The \fBs3qlctrl\fP command performs various actions on the S3QL file system mounted
in \fBmountpoint\fP.
.sp
\fBs3qlctrl\fP can only be called by the user that mounted the file system
and (if the file system was mounted with \fB\-\-allow\-other\fP or
\fB\-\-allow\-root\fP) the root user. This limitation might be
removed in the future (see \fI\%issue 155\fP).
.sp
The following actions may be specified:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B flushcache
.
Uploads all changed file data to the backend.
.TP
.B upload\-meta
.
Upload metadata to the backend. All file system operations will
block while a snapshot of the metadata is prepared for upload.
.TP
.B cachesize
.
Changes the cache size of the file system. This action requires an
additional argument that specifies the new cache size in kB, so the
complete command line is:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
s3qlctrl [options] cachesize <mountpoint> <new\-cache\-size>
.ft P
.fi
.TP
.B log
.
Change the amount of information that is logged into
\fB~/.s3ql/mount.log\fP file. The complete syntax is:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
s3qlctrl [options] log <mountpoint> <level> [<module> [<module> ...]]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
here \fBlevel\fP is the desired new log level and may be either of
\fIdebug\fP, \fIinfo\fP or \fIwarn\fP. One or more \fBmodule\fP may only be
specified with the \fIdebug\fP level and allow to restrict the debug
output to just the listed modules.
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The \fBs3qlctrl\fP command also accepts the following options, no matter
what specific action is being invoked:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-debug
.
activate debugging output
.TP
.B \-\-quiet
.
be really quiet
.TP
.B \-\-version
.
just print program version and exit
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Hint: run \fBs3qlctrl <action> \-\-help\fP to get help on the additional
arguments that the different actions take.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
\fBs3qlctrl\fP returns exit code 0 if the operation succeeded and 1 if some
error occured.
.SH SEE ALSO
.sp
The S3QL homepage is at \fI\%http://code.google.com/p/s3ql/\fP.
.sp
The full S3QL documentation should also be installed somewhere on your
system, conventional locations are \fB/usr/share/doc/s3ql\fP or
\fB/usr/local/doc/s3ql\fP.
