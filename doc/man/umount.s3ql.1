.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft C
umount.s3ql [options] <mount point>
.ft P
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
S3QL is a file system for online data storage. Before using S3QL, make
sure to consult the full documentation (rather than just the man pages
which only briefly document the available userspace commands).
.sp
The \fBumount.s3ql\fP command unmounts the S3QL file system mounted in the
directory \fImount point\fP and blocks until all data has been uploaded to
the storage backend.
.sp
Only the user who mounted the file system with \fBmount.s3ql\fP
is able to unmount it with \fBumount.s3ql\fP. If you are root and want to
unmount an S3QL file system mounted by an ordinary user, you have to
use the \fBfusermount \-u\fP or \fBumount\fP command instead.
Note that these commands do not block until all data has been
uploaded, so if you use them instead of \fBumount.s3ql\fP then
you should manually wait for the \fBmount.s3ql\fP process to
terminate before shutting down the system.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The \fBumount.s3ql\fP command accepts the following options.

background once all open files have been closed.

.SH EXIT STATUS

\fBumount.s3ql\fP returns exit code 0 if the operation succeeded and 1 if some
error occured.
.SH SEE ALSO
.sp
The S3QL homepage is at \fI\%http://code.google.com/p/s3ql/\fP.
.sp
The full S3QL documentation should also be installed somewhere on your
system, conventional locations are \fB/usr/share/doc/s3ql\fP or
\fB/usr/local/doc/s3ql\fP.
